# Postmux

PostMux is a simple JQuery web application that allows a user to configure multiple HTTP POST endpoints and then can forward an incoming POST request to each endpoint.

The backend is Ruby/Sinatra and the front-end is simple HTML5/JavaScript/Jquery.

It is ready to run on heroku and a test copy is hosted [here](http://postmux.herokuapp.com/).
